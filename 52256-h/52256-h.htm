<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_1'>1</span>The lead pencil, as everyone knows, is an invention of modern times, and may
unhesitatingly be placed side by side with the numerous improvements and
inventions, by means of which the last three centuries in particular have so
largely contributed towards the spread of Arts and Sciences and the facilitation
of Study and Communication. To the classic ages and their art the pencil and
in general every application of lead as a writing material was entirely unknown
and it was first in the middle ages, as we hear, that lead was employed for this
purpose. This metal however was by no means the same sort of thing as the
black lead of our pencils, which are indeed only mentioned in conjunction of
lead on account of the writing produced by them bearing some resemblance to
lead. Besides which lead was then only used for ruling lines and in no instance
for writing or drawing purposes. This leadruler was in form a sharpedged disc,
such as is said to have been used for the same purpose even in the later periods
of the classic ages.</p>

<p class='c014'>With the developement and growth of modern painting the traces of
pencil-like drawings first begin to manifest themselves. The masters of the
fourteenth century, especially <i>van Eyck</i>, and of the fifteenth, such as <i>Memlink</i>
and others, appear to be the first who mention works of art executed with a
pencil-like instrument upon chalked paper. They are generally designated as
drawings in silver-style, this specification however not being capable of any closer
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>confirmation, though this much is certain that the use of pure silver is not intended
to be implied. In like manner it is reported of the Italian artists of the
latter part of the middle ages, that they drew with a silver-style upon smooth
deal covered with the dust of calcined bones, which process appears however
only to have met with very partial success.</p>

<p class='c014'>On the other hand in Italy in the fourteenth century much drawing
was done with styles composed of a mixture of lead and tin; drawings that could
be effaced with bread crumb.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Petrarch’s</i> Laura was delineated by a contemporary in this manner
and in the time of <i>Michael Angelo</i> the process was still in use. These styles
were then introduced into Germany from Italy, under what particular name, we
know not. In Italy they are called “<i>Stile</i>”, but even they never seem at any
time to have been the universally acknowledged drawing material.</p>

<p class='c014'>About the same period the pen came into use as a drawing- as well as
writing-material, to which were added, in the most flourishing days of painting,
black chalk and red chalk which enjoyed extensive use. The Italians obtained
the best red chalk from Germany and the best black chalk from Spain. <i>Vasari</i>,
speaking of an artist of the sixteenth century, especially remarks that he understood
how to use style, pen, black chalk and red chalk with equal dexterity.</p>

<p class='c014'>To this period belongs also the discovery of black lead and with it the
production of an entirely new writing- and drawing-material—<i>The Lead Pencil</i>.</p>

<p class='c014'>This invention, which conferred so many benefits not only upon practical
life but also upon art, was made in England in the reign of Queen Elisabeth,
for in the year 1564 the celebrated blacklead mines of Borrowdale in Cumberland
were discovered. With the opening of this mine every element was present
to render the developement of an extensive pencil trade upon English soil possible.</p>

<p class='c014'>In the year 1565 the <i>first</i> lead pencils were manufactured in England.
The mines of Borrowdale, at one time on account of the valuable nature of their
produce exposed even to the predatory attacks of the inhabitants of the neighbouring
mountains, supply the English down to the present day with the material
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>for the best English leadpencils. The manufacturing of the lead obtained was
simple, the material, as soon as it came out of the mine, being cut to the proper
size with a saw and then without any further manipulation fastened into the
wood and it is remarkable, that the first pencils made in this manner are acknowledged
to be decidedly the best and down to the present day unsurpassed by
any other manufacture in the softness and delicacy of the lead. Although the
Cumberland pencils were soon in great request as being the first to really meet
an exigency long felt, it is their excellent quality that has given them their
lasting and universal reputation especially in the World of Art.</p>

<p class='c014'>The Cumberland mine only remained open for six weeks in the year
and yet the blacklead obtained in this short time is stated to have been of the
value of £ 40,000 or One Million Francs each time.</p>

<p class='c014'>The raw material was sent up to London just as it came from the
mine and there sold by auction in the <i>black lead market</i>, these sales taking
place on the first Monday in every month. The price averaged 36-40 shillings
per English pound and the value of the good Cumberland black lead according
to Dufrénoy was 400 Francs per Kilogramme.</p>

<p class='c014'>The fact of the English Government having considered it expedient
rigorously to prohibit the export of black lead in any other form than that of
leadpencils goes to prove of what importance these mines and the manufacture
of leadpencils in connexion with them was to England. In spite of the fact
however that the mines only remained open for six weeks in the year and that
no blacklead might be exported from them, the working of the mines, continued
as it was for upwards of a century, at last began to have the effect of
diminishing the yield, until at last nothing was to be obtained from them but an
inferior and impure material no longer adapted as before for the manufacture
of pencils.</p>

<p class='c014'>In order to protect themselves from the consequences of a failure of
the Cumberland blacklead mines, the English strenuously sought in every direction
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>for new blacklead deposits, but down to the present day without the desired
success. There remained therefore nothing but to look about for some means
whereby the impure refuse still obtainable could be purified.</p>

<p class='c014'>The process invented for this purpose consisted of first grinding the
blacklead to powder as soon as it came out of the mine, then purifying it as
much as possible from foreign substances by chemical means and finally compressing
it by means of a press in such a manner that the mass could be just as
easily cut as the pure Cumberland blacklead used to be. However notwithstanding
all the appliances of art and science were brought to bear upon the subject and
spite of every exertion to render this composition perfect, the English have not
hitherto succeeded in producing any material capable of replacing the natural
blacklead as obtained from the Cumberland mines.</p>

<p class='c014'>These circumstances operated as an inducement to search for a substitute,
which would admit of a greater economy in the use of blacklead. Experiments
were made in England with this view and various substances such as glue,
isinglass, tragacanth, gum &amp;c. were tried for the purpose of cementing and consolidating
the earthy blacklead into a firm mass. But none of these means succeeded.
Subsequently it was attempted to improve the blacklead by melting it with
minerals, compounding it with 30 or 40 per cent of sulphur. But this made
the blacklead too brittle and the pencils made by this process would hardly mark
at all. At last mixing with antimony was tried, which certainly yielded a composition
in outward appearance very similar to the pure blacklead, but which proved
to be but an unsatisfactory writingmaterial.</p>

<p class='c014'>Towards the end of last century the manufacture of leadpencils was
introduced into <i>France</i> and soon attained to an extensive developement. Hardly
were the last restrictions upon industrial freedom removed in that country, when
in the year 1795 the idea was started of making use of clay for the purpose of
binding the blacklead together. This process soon found favor on account of its
many advantages for by this commixture a great portion of the costly blacklead
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>was saved and at the same time the manufacture rendered materially easier, so
that the leadpencils could be supplied at a very much cheaper rate.</p>

<p class='c014'>By these novel improvements a fresh era in the manufacture of leadpencils
was commenced in France. Notwithstanding this however, there was yet
very much to be done in the department of blackleadpencil manufacture in order
to keep pace with the increased requirements of advancing art and more civilised
life.</p>

<p class='c014'>True, various degrees of hardness and different sorts of pencils were
thus obtained but these were by no means proportional to the various modes of
use. The manipulation of the brittle material demanded deep study, and conscientious
laborers in order to give the pencil the requisite perfection.</p>

<p class='c014'>If we now turn to <i>Germany</i>, it will in the first place be necessary
to cast a glance at the developement of German industry and German leadpencil
manufacture, it being then shown under what circumstances it had to
develope itself and with what rivals it had to enter into competition.</p>

<p class='c014'>It is not to be denied that from the very first German industry found
itself in a more disadvantageous position. France and England had already become
intrinsically industrious countries. They possessed immense facilities for
foreign trade, the greatest internal freedom of motion for the industrial element,
a legislature which took cognizance of all the requirements of industry, in short
both countries were, in comparison with Germany, favored by certain circumstances
which are indispensably necessary to render industry flourishing and which
were then already fulfilled, whereas in Germany political division and animosity
and the pressure of the guilds operated most perniciously upon industrial enterprise.</p>

<p class='c014'>For these reasons industry could only develope itself in Germany later
and then but slowly. The transition from the old to the new state of things
appeared much more difficult, as many long since antiquated forms, which had
become endeared to us by use, had first to be abolished.</p>

<p class='c014'>The Saxon spirit, which, on the other side of the Channel had attained
to such glorious results, had to sustain many a conflict in its native land, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>many a praiseworthy attempt suffered shipwreck on the many obstacles, which
the splitting up of the nation and the retention of unfeasable arrangements
opposed to every great idea.</p>

<p class='c014'>German science flourished at the same time to a very great extent,
but in its exaltation it stood too high above ordinary life, not perceiving how
to associate itself with it, so as to penetrate it with its enlightening and
warmthgiving rays. Thus German industry remained far behind foreign enterprise
and Germany beheld herself inundated with quantities of foreign manufactures,
which she herself could have produced just as well, indeed it came to
such a pass that foreigners relying upon their well organised commerce and the
celebrity of their products even ventured to send German manufactures into the
German market, stamped with a foreign trademark.</p>

<p class='c014'>German industry being at this low ebb, the manufacture of leadpencils
occupied but a very modest place. The first traces are to be found in the
village of <i>Stein</i> not far from <i>Nürnberg</i>. As far back as the year 1726 the
churchbooks mention marriages of “<i>Pencilmakers</i>”, subsequently also “<i>Blacklead
cutters</i>” male and female.</p>

<p class='c014'>Leadpencil making however was then in its very lowest state, as in no
case is a large establishment mentioned, and it may be assumed that this branch
of trade was only just able to maintain a precarious position in comparison
with the English manufacture.</p>

<p class='c014'>The Bavarian government however soon devoted their attention to this
branch of industry and sought to advance it. In the year 1766 a Count von
Kronsfeld received a concession for the erection of a leadpencil manufactory at
Jettenbach.</p>

<p class='c014'>But the manufacture, wanting as it was in material, experience and
custom, still remained so insignificant, that in “Beckmanns Technologie”, which
appeared in the year 1777 “Pencilmaking” merely received a quite superficial
and incidental notice.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>In the year 1816 the Bavarian government erected a Royal Leadpencil
manufactory at Obernzell (Hafnerzell) and introduced into this establishment the
French process already mentioned of using clay to consolidate the blacklead.</p>

<p class='c014'>When the new manufacture was in full play, the government transferred
the whole establishment into private hands as was intended from the commencement,
though the credit of having given the impetus to renewed activity on a large
scale certainly belongs to it.</p>

<p class='c014'>The establishment is now in the possession of the renowned Regensburg
manufacturer. In addition to this the leadpencil manufacture had taken root in
Vienna and an establishment was formed there, in which likewise the French
process of mixing the blacklead with clay was adopted.</p>

<hr class='c015' />

<p class='c014'>The now so extensive <i>leadpencil manufactory at Stein</i> sprung
from very modest beginnings. In the year 1760 namely its founder, <b>Kaspar
Faber</b>, settled in this village of <i>Stein</i> three miles from Nürnberg, and in the
year 1761 commenced the manufacture of leadpencils.</p>

<p class='c014'>At that time adverse external circumstances pressed heavily upon the
young manufactory, the whole possessions of its founder consisting only of a
small house situated on the Rednitz and surrounded by a small garden. A judicial
inventory dated 1786 still preserved in the family specifies faithfully the insignificant
property possessed by them, showing a nett result of “Fifty nine florins”.</p>

<p class='c014'>The finest and dearest qualities mentioned therein are spoken of as
“several gross of <i>English</i> pencils”, for thus the better German manufactures
had to disguise themselves under a foreign title. The demand for these manufactures
was trifling and purely local, as the spirit of commerce and enterprise did
but little to assist their introduction.</p>

<p class='c014'>Nürnberg and Fürth appear to have been the first to patronise the
products of the manufactory. To these places, as we know, the pencils finished
in the course of the week were carried on Saturdays in a basket; but the fact
of their having been well paid for goes to prove that even then their excellence
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>was acknowledged. The relations at that time existing between the producer
and the consuming public were however but little regulated. The producer stood
by himself alone, cut off from the world, which seemed to him too immensely
large for him to dare to step out into it. The farsighted vision, searching in
every direction to discover new wants and invent new improvements, were wanting
to him, as was also the beneficial influence of external relations, with which
he was never brought in contact.</p>

<p class='c014'>Nor was the consumer any more favorably situated.</p>

<p class='c014'>The article became the object of extensive commercial speculation and
had often to travel a very long way before it reached the hands of the consuming
public, nor was the repute of a good name any guarantee to the consumer
of the excellence of the article, for in order to keep the manufacturers in complete
dependance, the merchants would not allow them to mark their better products
with their names, but prescribed them foreign names and unmeaning signs,
such as: Harps, Stars etc.</p>

<p class='c014'>It was but slowly that the French process of mixing the lead with clay
gained ground and many years after the adoption of this process the workmen,
even in <i>Faber’s</i> manufactory, were still employed in working the Spanish lead
in the old fashioned way by melting it and cutting it with a saw.</p>

<p class='c014'>The progress of the French however soon forced the merchants to press
the Nürnberg manufacturers to advance, so as not to be left behind by competition.
After the introduction of the new composition the Nürnberg manufactories
soon found themselves favorably circumstanced and yielded satisfactory profits
both to the merchants and the manufacturers.</p>

<p class='c014'>But this was not to last. In the first ten years of this century competition
increased steadily and enormously so that demand by no means kept pace
with supply, and the vital question forced itself upon the manufacturers, whether
they were in a position to produce the article either better or cheaper?</p>

<p class='c014'>This difficult problem was however solved in a manner unfavorable to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>the manufacture, and with that revolution commences the decay of the same
which now began to make itself felt.</p>

<p class='c014'>The manufacture had, as before observed, become dependant upon the
trade of Nürnberg, which however no longer occupied its former high position,
for, although a considerable trade with foreign lands still existed, it was to a
great extent nominal. The enlargement and correction of ideas by foreign travel
and personal acquaintance with the grand advancement in foreign industry, were
wanting and thus no beneficial adjustment of the Nürnberg manufacture could
be brought about. Manufacture became the shuttlecock of commercial speculation,
which could not even so much as claim the credit of having successfully met the
increased requirements of the age or put a stop to powerful competition or an
overworked system of trade more calculated for the future.</p>

<p class='c014'>The trade of Nürnberg at that time lay in the fetters of the guild
system, the relic of an earlier golden time, which, aiming at the isolation of
industry, which was thereby given into its hands, was the ban that opposed its
progress for a length of time, alluring it to act contrary to the interests of
native industry and therefore contrary to its own interests.</p>

<p class='c014'>How much did this system leave of the ancient splendor and well
earnt renown of the City of Nürnberg?—A minimum kept and retained solely
and alone by the self denial, frugality and industry of the inhabitants. The ingenious,
serviceable articles had disappeared, giving place to goods, whose only
recommendation consisted in their being unprecedentedly cheap. The endeavour
to manufacture without the least regard to quality or serviceability as long as
cheapness was attained had become a rooted evil increasing as it descended in
all its fulness from father to son. The honorable distinction of the title “Nuernberg,
good” soon became changed into the lasting and contemptuous one of
“Nürnberg goods” and in the business world people even went so far as to say
that nothing good could possibly be produced at Nürnberg.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>These circumstances, which are to be laid to the account not only of
individuals but likewise of a domineering system and the spirit of a time not
so very far distant even now, attest that real industrial activity must go hand
in hand with mercantile spirit in order to maintain itself in the world free
from the influences above pointed out and enter the lists with competition. It
is only emancipated industry that can congratulate itself on real progress and
improve the article only by having an eye to the requirements of the consumer.</p>

<p class='c014'>It was under these circumstances that <b>Anton Wilhelm Faber</b>, the
son of the founder, whose name the firm still bears, and since 1810 <b>Georg
Leonhard Faber</b>, the father of the present proprietor, stood at the head of
the establishment.</p>

<p class='c014'>Many improvements had been attempted and several adopted; much
valuable experience had been gained, many processes in the manufacture had
been perfected and a number of intelligent workmen drawn together; spite of
all this however the mercantile relations above described operated most perniciously
upon the manufactory.</p>

<p class='c014'>The mode of manufacture induced by the enslavement of industry on
the part of trade more especially destroyed that conscientious strictness, which
must form the foundation of a solid industry. Things went so far that articles
were sent forth into the world, possessing the outward appearance of pencils,
the wood being just tipped with lead at each end as though it was properly
filled, whereas in fact you only had a useless stick of wood before you.</p>

<p class='c014'>Such swindling impositions, sent forth by the Nürnberg manufactories
into foreign countries, were well calculated to bring about a complete collapse and
it is difficult to regain confidence once deceived or esteem once forfeited. But
it must not be supposed that the interests of the Nürnberg pencil manufacture
were not solid. The unscrupulous transactions on part of some establishments as
a matter of course damaged the reputation of those which carried on their
business in an industrious and conscientious manner and the renown of the
whole trade was thus placed in jeopardy.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>In the year 1839 the present proprietor <b>Johann Lothar Faber</b>
undertook the management of the manufactory upon the death of his father
<i>Georg Leonhard Faber</i> abovenamed.</p>

<p class='c014'>This gentleman had, down to his nineteenth year, endeavoured as far
as possible to perfect his commercial education in Nuernberg in the most fundamental
and general manner and, from his earliest youth, especially devoted
himself to the study of everything at all bearing upon his father’s manufactory.
Even at that time he directed his attention not merely to his father’s affairs,
but also to the developement of a business so sadly crippled and underwent
many privations in order as much is possible to satisfy the manifold claims laid
upon him by the aim which was always present to his imagination.</p>

<p class='c014'>When nineteen years of age he went to Paris in order to increase his
stock of knowledge. There, in that capital of the World a greater range of
vision was opened to him and he beheld the operation of that restless spirit of
enterprise, which so mightily stirs the heart of the country. For the first time
the youth was brought face to face with the enormous business carried on both
with France and foreign lands and of which Paris is the centre. He surveyed
the fruits of a free, active industry, the great highroads, upon which commerce
flows from the mother country to distant lands, the realisation of a colossal
traffic, which allows no article to escape its observation and flows in an ever
moving wave between purchasers and consumers. Then his thoughts were carried
back to his distant native land with its industry so cramped and fettered
as to be altogether estranged from the great markets of the world and the
possibility flashed across his mind, that matters might be rendered very different
at home and native industry not only reconquer its honour and the renown of
its pristine good name, but that it might also be led forth from its narrow
prison and enabled to compete with the vigour and intelligence of the markets
of the world and that it would thus ensure obtaining an honourable position.</p>

<p class='c014'>At that time industrial life was in full activity at Paris, scarcely
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>six years having elapsed since the revolution of July and Louis Philippe being
firmly established on the constitutional citizen-throne.</p>

<p class='c014'>Thus great hopes filled the breast of the young man and impelled him
to follow up the ideas and plans of life he had adopted with all his energy.</p>

<p class='c014'>After a sojourn of three years in Paris there fell upon him suddenly
and unexpectedly, on the midst of his labours, the news of the death of his
father and after first performing a previously contemplated journey to London,
in order to enrich his store of knowledge and experience, he returned to his
native land in August 1839.</p>

<p class='c014'>Now was the time to carry out and realise all the ideas he had imbibed.
The condition of his father’s manufactory was, as before stated, extremely unsatisfactory.
Scarcely twenty workmen were employed and the annual business done
amounted only to about 12000 florins. If that glorious future, which the young
man had assigned to the manufactory in his imagination at Paris was to become
a fact, it would involve carrying on a conflict with all the old perverted notions,
to break with the cumbersome progress of former times and upon the ruins of
the Nürnberg trade, which beheld itself excluded from the world’s market, to
lay the foundations of a new commerce, which alone would be able to reconquer
for the venerable commercial city of Nürnberg her ancient renown.</p>

<p class='c014'>He was the man, who brought, in the first place certainly only the
pencil manufacture, but therewith also native industry in general, into direct
contact with the ideas of foreign countries.</p>

<p class='c014'>Sure and gradual progress was however indispensable. The new proprietor
adopted the device of:</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>“Truth, Respectability, Industry”</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>as the fundamental principle of his dealings, being firmly convinced, that no human
undertaking, which aspires to a future and lasting success, can possibly exist,
if it in any respect be based upon untruth, or at variance with that, which
passes for right and respectable among men in general or, which ignores the
duty of unwearying activity and energetic industry. These principles seemed to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>him all the more indispensable for his manufactory as he, by his position, rendered
himself to a certain extent responsible for the weal and woe of so many
souls.</p>

<p class='c014'>The two brothers of the new proprietor had been destined by their
father for other modes of occupation, there being at that time no prospect of
the pencil manufacture maintaining them.</p>

<p class='c014'>The present proprietor of the manufactory however, feeling confident
of the success of his comprehensive schemes, took to himself in the year 1840
his second youngest brother <b>Johann Faber</b>, who at that time carried on an
Hotel at Prague, in order to unite his activity with his own.</p>

<p class='c014'>The pencils were then only manufactured in proportionally few and
cheap sorts, but the new proprietor of the manufactory was soon induced to
introduce finer sorts at proportionate prices.</p>

<p class='c014'>While still at Paris he had endeavoured in every way by letters to his
father to conduce towards the elevation of the manufactory and the improvement
of the quality of the articles manufactured, but it was when he began to put
his hands to the work himself that he first aimed at any material success.</p>

<p class='c014'>These improved manufactures and especially his new so called Polygrade
Pencils, which have met with the greatest renown especially among artists, were
all marked with the name of the firm and, as they by reason of their increased
price, the unavoidable consequence of improved quality, met with but little countenance
among the Nürnberg merchants, the manufacturer travelled with them
himself through Germany, Russia, Austria, Belgium, Holland, France, England,
Italy and Switzerland and opened up business connexions with all the chief cities
of Europe, which, with the continued improvements in his manufactures, soon
found him a satisfactory custom and an ever increasing demand, important enough
to raise itself above the narrow sphere of local interests.</p>

<p class='c014'>In the interior of the manufactory two great improvements were undertaken,
as nearly every year called for some new addition. In these new erections
care was taken to construct them as roomy and light as possible, thus
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>taking into consideration the health of the workmen and the fact that work
is much better performed in sunny spacious rooms, than in gloomy dark vaults
in which the air cannot be renewed, and that the pleasure and zest with which
it is performed redounds to the benefit of the manufactory itself.</p>

<p class='c014'>The countless departments of business, in which pencils are used, by
degrees rendered an extensive and systematic classification necessary from the
long easel-pencil to the smallest pocketbook-pencil.</p>

<p class='c014'>The manufacture had, in consequence of its extensive foreign connexions,
already become considerably improved and extended and the varying tastes, even
the varying customs of the nations which used them, had to be taken into consideration.
The manufacturer never ceased to study all wants, to subject his
manufactures constantly to new trials, to avail himself of fresh experiences in
order to surpass with his products all similar articles if possible.</p>

<p class='c014'>The renown of his manufactures has penetrated to all parts of the
world and it is not merely their widely extended use, that attests their excellence,
but more especially the voice of those men, who make the greatest demands
upon the manufactory. There are few Architects and Engineers who use any
other article but <i>Faber’s pencils</i>, and the whole profession of artists has long
since proclaimed A. W. <i>Faber’s</i> pencil to be the very best for drawing purposes.
Such men as <i>Cornelius</i>, <i>Kaulbach</i>, <i>Bendemann</i>, <i>Lessing</i>, <i>Horace
Vernet</i> have expressed themselves to this effect.</p>

<p class='c014'>In accordance with this verdict is the result of the competition in the
several industrial Exhibitions, both at home and abroad, in which <i>Faber’s</i>
pencils gained the victory all over all other manufactures of the same nature.</p>

<p class='c014'>With the year 1849 a new era in the activity of the manufactory commenced.
Ever since that year the products of the manufactory had met with
recognition and custom in America and with the continued increase of the population
it was to be assumed that the sale of the same would also constantly
increase in importance, especially as the manufacture of leadpencils had not as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>yet taken firm root there and it therefore became a question of obtaining a
generally acknowledged product of European manufacture, the excellence of which
had been proved by the experience of years and its honest manufacture.</p>

<p class='c014'>This induced the proprietor of the manufactory to establish a house at
<i>New-York</i> and entrust the management of the same to his youngest brother
<b>Eberhard Faber</b>, who had just completed his study for the law at the universities
of Berlin and Erlangen and was at that time engaged in acquiring the
necessary mercantile knowledge in the establishment at Stein.</p>

<p class='c014'>The trade with America thereby acquired a firm footing, the communication
spite of the great distance became more regular and the connexion
of the manufactory with the new world more close. As <i>England</i>, <i>France</i>,
<i>Russia</i>, <i>Italy</i> and the East had long since been open to <i>Faber’s</i> manufactures,
the idea of creating an universal trade appeared to be realised.</p>

<p class='c014'>As in the American commercial metropolis, so also in Paris a house
was founded, not merely to manage the important trade with France and the
neighbouring countries, but also to minister to the fine tastes and elegant requirements
of the French, which are of so much advantage to any product intrinsically
excellent.</p>

<p class='c014'>In like manner, in order to supply the requirements of <i>England</i>,
<i>India</i> and <i>Australia</i>, an agency was established in London in the year 1851
with M<sup>r.</sup> <i>A. Heintzmann</i>, now <i>Heintzmann &amp; Rochussen</i>, of N<sup>o</sup> 9 Friday
Street, City, E. C.</p>

<p class='c014'>While thus the external relations of the manufactory continued steadily
to extend themselves, its internal developement likewise advanced step by step.</p>

<p class='c014'>On the very spot, where once the little house stood, the extensive
factory premises are now erected on either side of the Rednitz, the water power
of which river proving too insufficient and fluctuating, steam had to be called
into requisition and a large engine erected.</p>

<p class='c014'>As already stated, almost each year demanded an addition to the premises
and considerable enlargements and alterations rendered necessary partly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>by the constantly increasing business and partly by sanatory or ornamental considerations,
so that the very character of the locality underwent considerable change.</p>

<p class='c014'>Gardens now enclose the whole establishment on three of its sides. In
one of them stands the residence of the proprietor of the manufactory, <i>Lothar</i>,
visible from afar by reason of the height of its situation and remarkable on
account of the peculiarity of the style of its architecture; in the other the house
of his younger brother, <i>Johann</i>, so that everything stands together in the
closest connexion like the life of a large family.</p>

<p class='c014'>The proprietor, while endeavouring in every way to advance all the
ends of the manufactory in the most perfect manner, has not omitted to bear in
mind at the same time the moral and material welfare of his workmen, whom
he has accustomed himself to recognise as men and his fellow creatures.</p>

<p class='c014'>In their interest there were in the first place factory rules drawn up,
which regulated the duties and rights of the individual in the most precise
manner and especially took cognisance of the moral conduct of the workman.
They also gave the most diligent workmen and such as were more advanced in
years, opportunities of increasing their income by ensuring them an increase of
pay under certain conditions.</p>

<p class='c014'>In order to awaken and encourage a spirit of frugality in the men and
to render their future more comfortable and independant, a Workman’s Savings
<i>Bank</i> was instituted, with the following fundamental principles: Acceptance of
the smallest deposit at any time; interest at four per cent to commence as soon
as the deposit reaches the amount of five florins; deposits to be withdrawn
only on account of some notoriously pressing necessity. This institution found
immediate recognition and by degrees came into almost general favor, so
that now many an individual, who formerly had to battle with economical cares,
finds himself in the possession of a little property and rejoices in his wellregulated
family affairs.</p>

<p class='c014'>There is likewise a special fund for sickness.</p>

<p class='c014'>A library has also been founded by the master of the manufactory,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>accessible both to the workman and his family and well used by them, at the
same time too an infant school was started for the children of the work people.
He likewise originated and supported with his own means the erection of a new
schoolhouse, and embraced every opportunity of advancing the education therein.</p>

<p class='c014'>The social life of the workmen was also taken into consideration and
the taste for more elevating amusements, invigorating alike to soul and body,
encouraged. Of an evening they would meet in two singing societies to indulge
in the good German song, or on Sundays they would amuse themselves with the
crossbow in the free, fresh air of God’s Nature in the neighbouring forest, or
again on festive occasions they would all meet together like one large united
family for a sociable convivial repast.</p>

<p class='c014'>Finally, care was also taken that the workman should mix with the
world outside the factory, for which purpose a number of them were sent by
the master of the factory to the Industrial Exhibition at Munich in order that
they might themselves see the fruit of their labour publicly exposed to view and
honorably mentioned, and at the same time obtain a glimpse of other branches
of industry.</p>

<p class='c014'>Further, in order to provide new dwellings for the workmen a large
building was erected, of pleasing external proportions, and other buildings were
converted into workmen’s dwellings. The houses themselves contain separate
apartments, which afford the families at a low rent a much pleasanter abode
than could be obtained in most of the houses in the towns. Nor is there any
constraint; the houses are open to any body and the domestic regulations introduced
in the interests of the community are of that nature, that they are
cheerfully complied with by everyone. Thus there reigns in these premises a spirit
of order and contentment, which alone can make life agreeable.</p>

<p class='c014'>The village of <i>Stein</i> did not formerly possess any church. For years
all exertions to found a separate parish there remained fruitless, until at last the
year 1861 brought their reward and in that year, in which the manufactory
celebrated its hundredth anniversary, the peaceful clang of the bells for the first time
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>invited the faithful to divine service in the newly erected church, the cost of which
had been defrayed by the master of the factory entirely from his own means,
out of concern for the spiritual welfare of his workpeople and attachment to his
own native place.</p>

<p class='c014'>The formerly neglected little village has assumed quite a different appearance
since then. From afar the slender gothic steeple of the church may be
seen rearing its pinnacle proudly aloft, while the smoke of the surrounding shafts
tell of busy industry and labour. The former picture of want has given place
to a certain degree of wealth and the little garden of the humble house been
converted into two large parks.</p>

<p class='c014'>Simultaneously however with this prosperity in general the manufactory
had of course to experience some unpleasant incidents and obstinate struggles.
The universal demand for <i>Faber’s</i> manufactures was not slow in inducing other
manufacturers to imitate and pirate the trademark of the manufactory, which is
to be found on all articles manufactured there, and thus to pass off upon the
public spurious goods possessing nothing more than the external similarity to the
genuine articles, and which could scarcely aspire to mediocrity, which frauds
were often repeated, coming to light in various countries.</p>

<p class='c014'>The manufacturing firm of Rubenstein at Moscow adopted the plan of
making use of <i>Faber’s</i> trademark and wrappers for their own manufactures
and then to circulate them in the Russian market. These malpractises were
carried on for a length of time in spite of every exertion to put a stop to them
and the prohibition which the Russian Governement issued against the firm in
question. Manufactures with spurious trademarks were constantly turning up in
Russia until King <i>Maximilian</i> of Bavaria during his protracted stay at Nürnberg
in the year 1855 suppressed the evil. His lively interest for reviving industry
had already induced him to decorate the proprietor of the manufactory
with the order of merit of St. Michael, firstclass, in the year 1854, on which
occasion he likewise honoured the factory at <i>Stein</i> with a visit and made himself
acquainted with all the details of its operations from the mouth of the manager
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>of the factory, and as at that time these malpractises were brought before his
notice he gave the matter all his attention and promised some assistance.</p>

<p class='c014'>Nor had we to wait long for this, for shortly afterwards <i>Lothar Faber</i>
received a communication from the State ministry of the Royal House and Foreign
affairs, stating, that, by the intervention of the Royal Bavarian Embassy at
St. Petersburg, the evil had been put a stop to by the Russian Government; all
the articles marked with <i>Faber’s</i> trademark together with the stamp destroyed,
and the manager of the Russian manufactory compelled to give assurance in
writing that he would no longer pirate <i>Faber’s</i> trademark, in default rendering
himself liable to legal penalties.</p>

<p class='c014'>In New-York similar frauds were also carried on. Pencils manufactured
in Nürnberg with <i>Faber’s</i> trademark and in precise imitations of his wrappers
were imported and sold by the firm of Winterhoff, Piper &amp; C<sup>o.</sup>. Complaint
having been made, the Customhouse at New-York, at the instance of the examiner
appointed for the department of “Literature, Writingmaterials and fine Arts”,
detained one case of these spurious articles, whereupon the courts of law prohibited
all further sale in the town and county of New-York.</p>

<p class='c014'>A still more cunning fraud was perpetrated at Nürnberg. A deaf
and dumb lithographer by name Georg Wolfgang Faber was put forward, whose
name was to be made use of. The similarity of the surname and wrapper exactly
copied from those of <i>Faber’s</i> manufactory were sufficient to make the public
believe that they really had the genuine article from <i>Faber’s</i> manufactory
before them. On the intervention of the authorities, whom <i>Lothar Faber</i> put
in motion, the reputed manufacturer was subjected to an examination, which
proved him to be altogether incapable of producing such a thing as a serviceable
article and shewed that he had only lent his name to other speculators, whereupon
the Royal Government of middle Franconia withdrew the licence for pencil
making from the said G. W. Faber.</p>

<p class='c014'>Proceedings were likewise taken against a Pencilmanufacturer at Fulda,
who had manufactured and circulated upwards of seven thousand dozen leadpencils
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>with the false stamp “A. W. Faber”. The Criminal Court of the Electorate
of Hesse in a decision dated 2<sup>nd</sup> September 1856, condemned the defendant,
on account of fraud, to a pecuniary fine of 50 Thalers and further to
four weeks imprisonment, a decision, which the supreme Court of Appeal at Cassel
absolutely confirmed. Similar events took place in other countries with like
results.</p>

<p class='c014'>As the proprietor of the factory has hitherto proceeded against many
persons at home and abroad who had attempted to manufacture and sell pencils
in imitation of those of his firm he will further use all his efforts to suppress
every deception foisted upon the public.</p>

<p class='c014'>In the meanwhile the manufactory assiduously endeavoured to attain to
perfection in its products. As the stock of blacklead began to disappear in the
mines of Cumberland, it succeeded, by its perfected manipulation of the material,
in producing so many grades of hardness and supplying such an extensive variety
of pencil, that no demand could present itself without meeting with satisfaction
among the great choice of manufactures.</p>

<p class='c014'>In the opinion of connoisseurs the finest sorts even surpass the best
Cumberland leadpencils in their lasting and uniform degrees of hardness, their
greater firmness and durability as also in the increased purity of the lead. In
addition to this they possess such an amount of softness and delicacy, as to be
able to stand comparison in this and every particular with the Cumberland pencils.
Besides this, and in addition to several other improvements relating to
their external appearance, the most useful and ornamental shapes for pencils of
the finer descriptions were devised and introduced, and still more recently the
socalled “<i>Artist’s pencils</i>” were added to the list of novelties and immediately
met with the most universal recognition, which soon stimulated other manufacturers
to attempt imitations.</p>

<p class='c014'>In the midst of these exertions the news was suddenly received, that
that, which the English had so long sought for and which the perfected system
of manufacture still stood much in need of in order to yield more than was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>previously possible, had been found. A new blacklead mine had been discovered.
<i>Johann Peter Alibert</i>, merchant of the first class at Tabasthus in Siberia,
had undertaken an exploring expedition in the mountainous eastern portion of
Siberia, partly to search for gold. He examined the sand of the rivers Oka,
Belloi, Kitoi and Irkutsk, and in one of the mountain ravines in the vicinity of
Irkutsk lighted accidentally upon specimens of pure blacklead. <i>Alibert</i> immediately
recognised the value and importance of the material and instituted strict
investigations until in the year 1847 after much labor and exertion he arrived
at the conviction that, in a branch of the mountain range of Saian among the
heights of the Batougol mountains four hundred versts westward of the town of
Irkutsk, close to the frontier of China, a primitive deposit of blacklead must
exist. He addressed himself at once to the task of opening a mine in order to
bring the costly material to the surface.</p>

<p class='c014'>At first the blacklead met with proved to be no better than the
refuse Cumberland blacklead, and upwards of three hundred tons of this quality
had to be removed before a deposit of the best and purest blacklead was finally
opened up. Pieces were soon obtained weighing as much as eighty pounds. The
Academy of Sciences at St. Petersburg, before which body <i>Alibert</i> laid his
samples of blacklead for analysis, declared the same to consist of the same elements
and possess the same properties and consequently to be of precisely the
same nature as the Cumberland blacklead. <i>Alibert</i> now proceeded to England
where he visited the declining blacklead mines of Cumberland and convinced
himself by personal observation of the exhaustion and decay of the same. He
thereupon submitted his samples of blacklead to some of the most extensive
English leadpencil manufactories for examination, who unanimously confirmed
the verdict of the Academy at St. Petersburg, pronouncing the quality of the
Siberian blacklead to be excellent and in no way inferior to the Cumberland lead.</p>

<p class='c014'>It had cost <i>Alibert</i> eight years of unremitting labour and a capital
of one million Francs when he beheld his enterprise crowned with this certainly
unexpected success.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>He now turned his attention to rendering the newly discovered material
available for the manufacture of pencils. Having convinced himself that <i>Faber’s</i>
manufactory was the most extensive in existence and that it circulated the largest
amount of fine goods in the world, he applied to the same with a proposition
for an agreement, by virtue of which his blacklead was to be taken solely and
exclusively by that establishment for the manufacture of pencils.</p>

<p class='c014'>The firm on the other hand, having thoroughly convinced themselves
that the newly discovered blacklead was quite equal to the genuine and best
Cumberland blacklead in quality, willingly entertained this proposition of <i>Alibert’s</i>,
so that in the year 1856 a contract was entered into between the manufactory
and <i>Alibert</i> and sanctioned by the Russian Government, according to which all
the blacklead, which comes from the Siberian mines is to be delivered to <i>A. W.
Faber’s</i> manufactory, and to no other establishment for the purposes of pencil
manufacture, now and for all time.</p>

<p class='c014'>It was a mighty work which the restless energy of <i>Alibert</i> had
brought into execution in a land so difficult of access. On the summit of the
mountain of Batougol, which now in the Russian maps of the country is designated
by the name of “<i>Alibertsberg</i>” in honorable remembrance of the discoverer
of the blacklead mine, <i>Alibert</i> assembled all his working force and a
little colony soon sprung up, which addressed itself zealously to the new mining
operations.</p>

<p class='c014'>The miners brought the blacklead to the surface in large blocks and
the material thus obtained proclaimed at once, by its external purity and a
beautiful silvery lustre, its excellent value and composition. The transport was
attended with immense difficulties. The blocks of blacklead, carefully packed in
wooden cases, had to traverse enormous tracts of country, across which not the
least vestige of a road is to be found, upon the backs of reindeer to reach the
nearest seaport, whence they were shipped to Europe, while other consignments
of the blacklead were forwarded to the manufactory exclusively by land.</p>

<p class='c014'>It may be conceived that <i>Alibert</i> by this discovery drew even the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>attention of the Russian Government upon himself and was gratified by the
kindest encouragement both on part of the Czar and the Governor of the province
of Irkutsk, Count <i>Murawiew Amursky</i>. In the report concerning explorations
in Siberia issued by the imperial Academy of Sciences the discoverer is
mentioned particularly (page 33) and at the same time <i>Faber’s</i> manufactory,
the capital of which has facilitated and advanced this enterprise, is honorably
spoken of.</p>

<p class='c014'>The manufactory, thus in possession of so extensive a store of blacklead,
the excellence of which both theory and practice place on a level with
the Borrowdale lead, has produced pencils made with the Siberian lead ever
since the year 1856. It was now no longer a question of attaining to the standard
of the Cumberland pencils but rather of surpassing it.</p>

<p class='c014'>The new material was worked partly in a natural state so as to enable
connoisseurs to convince themselves of its excellent quality and partly artificially
manufactured, which yielded as a result such a degree of evenness, purity and
unchanging hardness as had never before been obtained, not even in the best
Cumberland pencils. After the exertions of six years the manufactory is just
now intending to enter the World’s market with its new productions.</p>

<hr class='c015' />

<p class='c014'>Before we conclude our sketch we must stop to contemplate a bright
spot in the internal history of the factory and remember the day on which it
celebrated the completion of the hundredth year of its existence with a festival,
to which the joyful feelings of a happy and contented population and the not
less hearty than general participation therein from far and near, lent a peculiar
solemnity.</p>

<p class='c014'>The festival was celebrated by the proprietor of the manufactory <b>Johann
Lothar Faber</b> and his brother <b>Johann Faber</b> together with their families
and in the midst of the assembled factory hands male and female, as also of all
masterworkmen employed for the manufactory and a large number of invited guests.</p>

<p class='c014'>The 16<sup>th</sup> September 1861 was the day fixed for the occasion, chiefly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>with the view of rendering the festival all the more impressive by a special
celebration of divine service in the new church of the village, which had only
been consecrated a fortnight before. Preparations of the most varied character
occupied both the masters of the factory and their families for some time previously,
in order to render this auspicious and happy event a thoroughly joyous festival
for their workpeople and all that participated therein, and the remembrance of
it no less pleasing than indelible.</p>

<p class='c014'>Similar feelings however also actuated the workpeople, who exerted
themselves with all their power to add to the splendor of the festival, and
manifest their good feelings and gratitude in a touching and unexpected manner.</p>

<p class='c014'>On the eve of the festive day the workmen in a body brought their
master a torchlight procession, which, after passing through the whole of the
gaily decorated premises, came to halt in the courtyard of Mr. <i>Faber’s</i> house,
whereupon the workmen’s singing club performed three partsongs composed expressly
for the occasion.</p>

<p class='c014'>A deputation of workmen consisting of men who had been longest in
the factory then handed the master, together with an appropriate address made
by their senior member, a handsome and tasteful album as a festive present from
them, and a parchment roll on which were printed a dedication composed in
verse, then the speech which a workman made in the most spirited manner
previous to the presentation of the album, further the songs performed and a
list of the names of all the workmen and women. This was certainly one of
the most affecting moments and even those men, who had become grey in the
service of the factory were unable to restrain their tears of emotion and gratitude.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Lothar Faber</i> in his reply dwelt particularly upon how he valued
the proofs of love, attachment, gratitude and faithfulness shown to him as being
not merely intended for himself alone but likewise for his whole house and more
especially for his two brothers standing so faithfully by his side, and how he
wished that these sentiments of the workpeople might ever spread among them
and be manifested to him and his family for all time.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>On the morning of the sixteenth of September all the workmen and
women assembled at the house of <i>L. Faber</i> in order to receive the festive
present appointed for each person as also a commemoration medal coined expressly
for this festival, having on the one side the arms of the family with the
legend: “Founder: <i>Kaspar Faber</i> † 1784; Successors: <i>A. W. Faber</i> †
1819; <i>G. L. Faber</i> † 1839; <i>J. L. Faber</i>”; and upon the Obverse the legend:
“In remembrance of the Century Jubilee of the Leadpencil Manufactory of
<i>A. W. Faber</i> at Stein near Nürnberg.”</p>

<hr class='c015' />

<p class='c014'>The festive clang of bells now summoned all present to the special
divine service, which was destined to form a worthy commencement to the
festival and all the factory hands arranged themselves in a stately procession,
which, headed by the members of the <i>Faber</i> family, moved towards the church
in order there to give vent to the feelings of gratitude in a pious and christian
manner. A sermon was preached, the text being taken from the 90<sup>th</sup> Psalm,
verses 16. 17 and at the conclusion of the service all the workpeople male and
female assembled at eleven o’clock at the workmen’s dwellinghouses in the village
of Stein built by <i>L. Faber</i>, from whence they started in a procession, headed
by the band of the fourteenth regiment of infantry stationed at Nürnberg, for
the park of <i>L. Faber</i>, one portion of which nearest the dwellinghouse had been
specially arranged for the festival partly for the entertainment of the numerous
guests and partly for various amusements of play and dance, and which, by its
elegant decorations and appropriate mottoes, bearing upon the past and present
of the Factory, made the most agreeable impression upon every one. Arrived
upon the festive grounds the entire body of workpeople about four hundred in
number partook of the dinner provided for them, the regimental band performing
agreeable music the while. The repast concluded, <i>L. Faber</i> mounted a
tribune especially erected for this occasion and ornamented with lifesize busts
of the departed ancestors, and in a short speech set before them the chief
features of the history of the manufactory, impressing upon them, on the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>commencement of the second century of its existence, the value of that order and
carefulness which are so indispensably necessary for the prosperous career of a
large establishment in the requirements of our age, and concluding with a cheer
for the existence and welfare of the Factory in which all joined vociferously.</p>

<hr class='c015' />

<p class='c014'>The two youngest boys of the family, <i>Wilhelm</i> the son of <i>L. Faber</i>
ten years and <i>Ernst</i> the son of his brother <i>Johann</i>, seven years of age hereupon
ascended the steps and while the former greeted his father with a poem
in the name of the four surviving brothers and sisters of <i>L. Faber</i>, the latter
presented him with a silver goblet also in their name as a souvenir of the
festival.</p>

<hr class='c015' />

<p class='c014'>By three o’clock the number of the guests had increased to nearly six
hundred. They amused themselves with all sorts of games, to which the drawing
of prizes lent an especial charm, and with dancing round the lofty maypole
erected on the grass plot, or with wandering through the park, which was
entirely thrown open, while the band charmed the ear with its performances.
In the midst of this lively scene of rejoicing, which partook of the appearance
of a national gathering, the Master of the Factory <i>L. Faber</i>, together with
all others present were surprised in the most agreeable manner by the arrival of a
gracious autographic missive from <i>His Majesty</i> the King, which read as follows:</p>

<p class='c016'>“On the 16<sup>th</sup> inst. you celebrate, as I am given to understand
the completion of the first Century of the existence of the manufactory
founded by your ancestors and whose well earnt fame both at home and
abroad redounds to the honor of Bavarian industry. It has likewise given
me special pleasure to observe the care, with which you watch over the
moral and temporal affairs of your workpeople. The festival which you
are about to keep, affords me an opportunity of offering my best congratulations
to you and the establishment conducted by you with so much
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>success and at the same time of expressing the hope that the manufactory
will be blest with continued prosperity.</p>

<p class='c017'>With the sincerest good wishes</p>

<p class='c018'>Hohenschwangau 14. September 1861.</p>

<div class='c019'>Your affectionate King</div>
<div class='c020'><b>Max.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>

<div class='lg-container-l c021'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>To</div>
      <div class='line'>Mr. <i>Johann Lothar Faber</i> Manufacturer.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c022'>With joyous emotion <i>L. Faber</i> communicated this gracious mark of
honour to all assembled, by reading it aloud from the tribune, concluding with
a triple cheer for His Majesty King <i>Max</i> in which every one joined with the
greatest spirit.</p>

<p class='c014'>He then gave the health of his two brothers, who so faithfully and
energetically seconded his exertions, which was received with joyous acclamations
echoing again and again from the vast assembly; then his fellowworkers for the
manufactory outside its pale, as also all his business friends and especially the
artists, who, by patronising his manufactures and appreciating their value for
art had so materially contributed to the extension of his fame. <i>L. Faber</i>
thereupon recited a poem the fundamental idea of which was the motto of the
manufactory:</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>“Truth, Respectability, Industry.”</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>This recital served as an introduction to the unveiling of an allegorical
tableau executed by <i>Maar</i> of Nürnberg representing partly the activity of the
Factory, and mercantile enterprise, and partly an appropriate allusion to the
Jubilee festival. Then a short address followed by the presentation of a congratulatory
testimonial to <i>L. Faber</i> on part of the authorities of the council of
trade of Nürnberg was made, which elicited a cheer for the same. Then <i>Maar</i>
the artist made a speech upon the history of the lead pencil and its application
to Art, thanking <i>L. Faber</i> in the name of his colleagues for the cheer given
them and concluding with a toast for the establishment.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>A small brochure setting forth the contents of the Festival Album before
mentioned and containing a capital piece of poetry composed by a relation
of the <i>Faber</i> family was then distributed among the guests.</p>

<p class='c014'>A number of speeches and toasts were now made and given by the
workmen themselves, who were fairly carried away by excitement, which one
and all breathed a spirit of attachment and gratitude, and of which not a few,
spite of their simple character, caused feelings of emotion. Performances of
their singing clubs alternated with those of the band until as darkness drew near
the illumination of the festive grounds and an extensive portion of the park
presented a fresh tableau. Bengal lights illumined several of the more lovely
points and a pyrotechnic display brought the festival to a conclusion at nine
o’clock, when all the participators departed in the gayest spirits and with hearty
wishes for the continued prosperity of the Manufactory.</p>

<p class='c014'>The foregoing description of the Jubilee festival of <i>A. W. Faber’s</i>
Pencil manufactory may be appropriately closed with the mention off a transaction
which was no less a gratification than an honor to the proprietor of the same:</p>

<p class='c014'>On the morning of the eighth of October a deputation of the magistracy
and representatives of the Commune of Nürnberg, consisting of the two Burgomasters,
<i>von Wächter</i> and <i>Seiler</i> and the President of the College of the
Commune, Dr. <i>Lindner</i>, proceeded to Stein in order to present <i>Johann
Lothar Faber</i> with the diploma of honorary citizenship of the City of Nürnberg,
which reads as follows:</p>

<p class='c016'>“The Magistrate and representatives of the Commune of the Royal
Bavarian city of Nürnberg have conferred upon Mr. <i>Johann Lothar
Faber</i>, proprietor of the Pencil manufactory at Stein in the Royal Jurisdiction
of Nürnberg, in appreciation of the many and important services,
which he has rendered to industry in general and the trade of Nürnberg
in particular, by an unanimous resolution the honorary citizenship of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>city of Nürnberg, and, after obtaining the most gracious consent of His
Majesty the King, caused this deed to be drawn up for him. Given under
the great seal of the city and the signatures of the two Burgomasters as
also that of the President of the College of the Commune.</p>

<p class='c023'>Nürnberg the 16<sup>th</sup> September 1861.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>

    <div><i>Lindner</i>, President of the Presentatives of the Commune.”</div>
  </div>
</div>

<hr class='c025' />

<p class='c013'>The celebration of the hundreth anniversary of the existence of the Factory
afforded the proprietor of the same a welcome opportunity of dedicating this
memoir to all his honoured business friends and patrons as a token of his gratitude
and esteem and at the same time of giving them a pretty perfect sketch
of his Factory and a view of its internal arrangement. With this latter object
he had the nine views, attached to the end hereof, taken, which represent a
faithful sketch of the chief points of the establishment and by means of which
it is possible to form a tolerably accurate idea of the Lead pencil Manufacture.</p>

<p class='c014'>The <i>first plate</i> represents the sluicing process. On the left hand
side of the picture the blacklead is seen in its original casks, on the right hand
side the clay. These two raw materials are here washed and then passed on in
pans to be dried.</p>

<p class='c014'>The <i>second plate</i> shows the grinding which goes on day and night,
the composition of blacklead, clay &amp;c. being ground fine while in a wet state,
and then dried in ovens especially adapted for that purpose.</p>

<p class='c014'>The <i>third plate</i> depicts the preparation of the lead. The workmen
to the left in the background are forming a plastic mass of the composition by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>wetting it with water, which while still wet is passed into the cylinder of the
press where it is forced through a copper plate, at the bottom of the cylinder,
in the centre of which there is an opening of a peculiar shape. As is seen in
the representation the lead thus pressed through the cylinder assumes the shape
of a ring and is then carried by the workmen on the right upon boards and
lying in a straight position, to a moderately warm place to dry. Before however
the lead is completely dry, it is cut into sticks of the proper length for filling
the pencils. After the drying comes the annealing in peculiarly constructed
ovens. This process takes place in hermetically closed vessels of clay or iron
in which the sticks of lead are placed in a horizontal position.</p>

<p class='c014'>In the <i>fourth plate</i> the method of cutting, sawing and planing the
wood is seen. In the foreground to the right lies a balk of Florida Cedar
wood. These balks are from 10 to 15 feet in length and 8 to 24 inches in
thickness. They are first cut across with an upright saw in pieces of the length
of a pencil, which pieces are then cut into sticks by small circular saws as
shown on the right hand side of the view, the sticks being thereupon planed
smooth by the machine in front. Behind the planing machine the grooving
machines are situated by means of which the smoothly planed sticks are cut
with fine circular saws into top and bottom pieces, the latter of which are
furnished with grooves.</p>

<p class='c014'>The <i>fifth plate</i> represents the process of glueing the sticks of lead
into the wood. At each glueing table there are three workmen, one of whom
smears the two pieces of wood with glue, while the second places the lead in
the groove and the third, after the two pieces are fixed together, trims the
pencils, which are then placed in a press and firmly pressed together by means
of screws. The round bundles seen in this view are partly finished pencils and
partly tops and bottoms.</p>

<p class='c014'>At this stage of the manufacture the pencils are all square and are now
passed on to the planing shop represented in the <i>sixth plate</i>. There they
are cut to the exact length by means of fine circular saws and then planed round
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>or square, oval or even hexagonal or trigonal by the planing machines, which
they reach in a square form.</p>

<p class='c014'>The seventh and eighth plates show those operations which are carried
on by females.</p>

<p class='c014'>In the <i>seventh plate</i> to the right the workwomen are seen engaged
in polishing the pencils with colours, and to the left those who by means of a
lever press stamp the name of the firm upon them.</p>

<p class='c014'>At last the polished and stamped pencils arrive at the room, where
they are made up into packets as represented in the <i>eighth</i> plate. Here they
are fastened up in dozens, covered with tickets and packed either by the dozen
or the gross.</p>

<p class='c014'>The <i>ninth plate</i> represents the dwelling houses and manufacturing
Premises. The residence on an elevation to the left is that of the proprietor
of the Manufactory, below which is seen that of his brother. The two houses
in the middle were dwellinghouses in former times and have been used for years
as Countinghouse, Warehouse and Sample-show-room. The workshops lower down
on the right stand close to the river Rednitz and the machinery therein is set
in motion by waterpower, whereas in the other premises higher up steam is
the agent employed.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
